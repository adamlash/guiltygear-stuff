[19:05] Mr.G: the input you do on wakeup
[19:06] Mr.G: actually
[19:06] Mr.G: hold on
[19:06] Mr.G: vogue actually has a youtube video for this
[19:06] Mr.G: i should look for it since it should be pinned here anyway
[19:09] Mr.G: cant seem to find it
[19:10] Mr.G: i thought i could find it in haehyun discord by ctrl+F'ing 414 but i just see discussions not the video
[19:12] Mr.G: fuck it ill just find it later , anyway @Ultimate9Tailed Babbaloo

basic kum mixup involves, red ball into 5H(first hit whiffs, second hit clips you), 6k
[19:13] Mr.G: 5h and 6k have sorta similar looking startup animations
[19:13] Mr.G: so it can be hard to react to
[19:13] Mr.G: what waking up with 414 motion while FD'ing does
[19:13] Mr.G: is you standblock+FD the red ball
[19:13] Mr.G: which pushes you into range of 5H not whiffing
[19:13] Mr.G: 5H first hit is faster than 6k
[19:13] Mr.G: so its much easier to react to whether or not they did 5H or 6K



"HOW TO DEFEND AGAINST LAYER 1 KUM MIXUP
so you know how 5HS has two hits to it?
the first one is a mid
and the second is the overhead
5HS is only scary if you're crouching, because that way the first hit will whiff and the overhead will land in like 18 frames
pretty much impossible to react to especially when you consider 6K which looks almost the same
so the idea is that you should try to make your character stand upright safely as much as possible
one way to do that is by blocking the ball while you're standing, then instantly shifting your block low
you'll be guarding against the mixup low, but your character will be in standing blockstun
so what happens is that if I go low, you block it
if i go high with 5HS, the first mid hit will connect against your character
which slows down the move/puts you in blockstun
it gives you time to react to the 2nd hit (the overhead)
so you can shift your guard high
by using this trick you block all of kum's layer 1 mixup free"
