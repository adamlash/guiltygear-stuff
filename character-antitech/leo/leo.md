**Training Mode Findings**

**Normals to punish**
*5H*

```
Char: Leo | Move: 5H
Startup: 15f | Active: 6f | Recovery: 17f
Frame adv.: -3 | IB adv: -7 | Level: 4
Guard: Mid | Tension: 384 | RISC: -6 / +20 | Prorate: - | Invul: - | Damage: 42 | Notes: Vacumms, Inputting H(or holding) on 24~26F causes transition to Brynhildr stance, transition starts from frame 27, Stance transition is 11F long(last 1F can be canceled into any action other than walk), Can go into 5H~P from 25F
```
Looks Like:
- Leo spreads his wings wide, YMCA style

Leo's Use Case:
- In his combos leading into his rekkas (eg, 5K>CS>FS>6H>Rekkas)

Punishes:
- 2P will fit as its a -3, with out without IB

Extra Notes:
- he can go into backturn if he holds the button. If he does that you can 2P, 2K or 2D (depending on spacing)


**special moves and rekkas to worry about**
*Flash Kick*

```
Char: Leo | Move: Eisen Sturm (S) ([2]8S)
Startup: 5f | Active: 3,12f | Recovery: 26+12 After Landingf
Frame adv.: -32 | IB adv: -36 | Level: 2,3
Guard: Mid | Tension: 250 / 600x2 | RISC: -7,-6 / +10,+14 | Prorate: 85 | Invul: 1~4 Full, 8~Airborne | Damage: 36,32 | Notes: -

```
Char: Leo | Move: Eisen Sturm (H) ([2]8H)

```

Looks Like:
- Big Ass flash kick

Punishes:
- If blocked, big 6H
- Usual 2H loops work as well.

Extra Notes:
- Apparently Ball YRC is wonky on this move.


*Rekkas Chapters*

Rekkas Overview:
- There are 3 Rekkas: Erst, Zweit, Dritt
  - *Erst* is the *first*.
  - Then he can use *Zweit*, either he can link if he lands Erst or use in neutral. and from there he will go into *backturn stance* to
  - the player can then use *Dritt* anytime during backturn.

*ZWEIT CAN ALSO BE USED RAW NEUTRAL*

```
Char: Leo | Move: Kaltes Gestöber Erst (236S)
Startup: 15f | Active: 3f | Recovery: 12f
Frame adv.: -1 | IB adv: -4 | Level: 2
Guard: Mid | Tension: 125 / 300 | RISC: -7 / +10 | Prorate: - | Invul: - | Damage: 24 | Notes: -
```

```
Char: Leo | Move: Kaltes Gestöber Zweit (236H)
Startup: 24f | Active: 4[5]f | Recovery: 14f
Frame adv.: 1[2] | IB adv: -3 | Level: 4
Guard: Mid | Tension: 250 / 384 | RISC: -6 / +20 | Prorate: - | Invul: - | Damage: 32 | Notes: [] indicates crossup; Front / Behind detection on 25F; 28F untech duration on air hit
```

```
Char: Leo | Move: ->Kaltes Gestöber Dritt (Stance > 214S)
Startup: 14f | Active: 5f | Recovery: 21f
Frame adv.: -7 | IB adv: -11 | Level: 4
Guard: Mid | Tension: 250 / 720 | RISC: -6 / +20 | Prorate: Forced 70 | Invul: - | Damage: 60 | Notes: Exits stance
```

Looks Like:
*Erst*
- Running charge slashing scissor movement

*Zweit*
- he runs through the character and then slashes em
- this will still runthrough after blocking

*Dritt*
- does a 360 slash and turns faceward again


Punishes:
*Erst*
- not really punishable

*Zweit*
- Throwable when he runs through with an IB
- 2p-able as well with or without IB
- if its *NEUTRAL ZWEIT* you can throw it but after throwing you gotta hold it, no 2p.

*Dritt*
- -7 so pretty unsafe
- can be spaced so punish with your relative spacing button, 2P, 2K and 2D will work (2D is close)

Extra Notes:
- Keep in mind differences between Neutral and Rekka Zweit
- IBing Zweit is where its at.

*Siegesparade*

```
Char: Leo | Move: Siegesparade (j236H)

```

Looks Like:
- Big ass overhead boot

Punishes:
- Beat him on his startup this is unblockable as hell, throw a dolphin, 2p or something it
- It has quite the range so jump it if he does it far, jumping is also fine in general sinec its 29f of recovery

Extra Notes:
- Unblockable
- When he uses it, whiff or otherwise it brings him back to normal stance.

```

Looks Like:
- Leo does a twirl and comes down

When is it used:
- gatlings from 5h, 6p and fs so probably after one of those, tends to go from 6H into his rekkas.

What to do:
- Hold That, wait for the rekkas.

Other Notes:
- Not an overhead...


*Backturn Stance*
- fucking everything. be careful
- extra credit to 5K that piece of shit
- 6H is ACTUALLY AN OVERHEAD HERE
